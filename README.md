# Redux Tools

A collection of tools for maintaining large Redux applications by enabling dependency injection of Redux code and development of multi-instance components by namespacing their state.

Redux Tools consist mainly of:

- [Store enhancers](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/docs/Glossary.md#store-enhancer) for injecting reducers, epics, and middleware into your Redux store after the store is created.
- Utility functions for less verbose definitions of action creators and reducers.

## Documentation & API Reference
